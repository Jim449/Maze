                <p class="p-2">The maze generator allows for the construction of complex mazes.
                    The aim is to generate mazes which can be used in games,
                    where the game creator requires a high amount of control
                    over the mazes layout.
                    After a maze has been generated, the user can test it out
                    by moving pieces around.
                </p>
                <h3 class="p-2">The maze generator is capable of:</h3>
                <ul class="p-2 pl-6 list-disc">
                    <li>Generating a maze given detailed instructions.
                        Each room in the maze is given room number, depending on the rooms location and purpose.</li>
                    <li>Generated mazes can be saved in json format or as images.</li>
                    <li>The blueprint of a maze can be saved in json format.
                        By calling the API, any number of random mazes can be constructed at will.</li>
                    <li>After the maze has been generated, it's possible to place pieces, move them around, or remove
                        them.
                        Pieces can be instructed to move in random directions, simulating games played out on the maze.
                    </li>
                    <li>The maze generator is capable of keeping track of turns,
                        listing all pieces in play, and displaying which pieces have yet to move.</li>
                    <li>It's possible to generate mazes with one-way paths,
                        or rooms which are guaranteed to only have one entrance.</li>
                    <li>Room design and color can be customized.
                        Each area of the maze can be given its own design.</li>
